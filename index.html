                <p>As a Senior Research Associate, I have assisted my manager and am the de-facto manager in his absence. I am readily adaptable to all aspects of a job and I consistently demonstrate
                    effective leadership skills and can adapt to any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. My years of experience coupled with my Master’s Degree in Business Administration has 
                    given me the qualifications to meet the expectations of the position.</p>                     
                <p>Throughout my career I have been recognized as a team leader by example and by service.
                    I am an enthusiastic employee with exceptional verbal and writing skills that are essential 
                    to building alliances and to motivate team members in accordance to their strengths and abilities, 
                    and the goals of the organization. I am a problem solver who executes efficient and innovative
                    solutions that will contribute to the overall success of the district.</p>
