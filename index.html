                <p>As a Senior Research Associate, I have assisted my manager and am the de-facto manager in his absence. I
                    am readily adaptable to all aspects of a job and I consistently demonstrate effective leadership skills
                    and can adapt to any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. My years of experience coupled with my
                    Masterâ€™s Degree in Business Administration has given me the qualifications to meet the expectations of
                    the position.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career I have been recognized as a team leader by example and by service. I am an enthusiastic
                    employee with exceptional verbal and writing skills that are essential to building alliances and to motivate
                    team members in accordance to their strengths and abilities, and the goals of the organization. I am
                    a problem solver who executes efficient and innovative solutions that will contribute to the overall
                    success of the district.</p>
