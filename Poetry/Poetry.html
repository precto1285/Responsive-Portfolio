			<h2>The Seed</h2>
			<p>Deep beneath me lays a seed that craves for water. To be bathed a kinetic force from within. <br/>I seek the need that nature requires. To fullfill a promise to reach its peak. To reach and to break free with color and pain. <br/>To struggle for more as we feed the hunger. To take energy from light and air. To feel the blossom that shows my nature.<br/> To wilter and to faulter. To go back from wence you came. To make room for another. So we can repeat this garden again.</p>

			<h2>Vicious Love</h2>
			<p>A ruthless show of affection with her gnashing teeth, she aims to impress her boy. A sigh echoes<br/> in the chambers they dwell, dancing on three legs at a time. To viciously scorn her captured prey.<br/> To sleep in the arms of her life. "I shall impress again tomorrow" she claims, without hesitation or snide.</p>

			<h2>Dancing Dots</h2>
			<p>From one on to another, they move just like no other, a pattern that moves with your mind. <br/>A wand of precision, and a headdress to quicken. a curly <i>line</i> to stop you on time. steps on the <i>lines</i><br/> will be filled with my <i>lines</i> and <strong>repeated</strong> till they come to the bridge.<br/> As far as it goes, the silence aproach, and bows to the end of the <i>line</i>.</p>

			<h2>Say Something</h2>
			<p>Say, speak, show, touch. A movement, a brow lightens. a grimace of dispair or shame. <br/>As all things crumble and shatter. As time stood still in her pain. Sorry, what?, sorry, why? An exchange of discomfort. <br/>A shiver strangles the pride and ruffles the fear. A glimpse into a reality of hurt. <br/> A trust beyond its repair. Cry. Leave. Gone. Something.</p>

			<h2>Bursting at the Seams</h2>
			<p>You want it to implode so you can make a move. A slow ripping silence builds. <br/>It breaks and burns and so you learn and become the new born from inside. <br/>An interest practiced, chance of new breathe, an opportunity to succeed and become. <br/>A dream i once had of being complete. A window of freedom, my home.</p>
